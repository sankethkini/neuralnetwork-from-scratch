#  Neural Network-from-scratch
  A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.
  Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems.
  The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. 
  All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred as a linear combination.
  
  These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset.
  Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information
